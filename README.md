# Banking-System
The Banking System (RSB) is a user-friendly, object-oriented banking application developed in Python using Tkinter for the graphical user interface (GUI). It provides a simulated banking environment where users can manage their accounts, perform transactions, and track their financial history with ease. This project demonstrates key programming principles such as Object-Oriented Programming (OOP), GUI development, and event-driven programming.

Designed for both learning and practical usage, the system offers a seamless experience for users to deposit, withdraw, transfer funds, and view transaction history—all within a structured and intuitive interface.
